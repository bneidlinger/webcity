# Road Generation System Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the procedural road generation system in `simcity-web-starter/src/workers/procgen.worker.ts` with sophisticated algorithms for creating realistic, era-appropriate road networks that combine organic growth patterns with structured grid layouts.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Organic Growth Pattern
- **Poisson Disk Sampling**: City centers are distributed using Poisson disk sampling to ensure proper spacing
- **Golden Angle Distribution**: Radial roads use golden angle (137.5°) for optimal distribution
- **Organic Path Generation**: Roads follow natural curves using sine-based perturbations
- **Growth Simulation**: Roads emanate from centers with distance-based falloff

### 2. Smart Intersection Management
- **Angle Constraints**: Enforces minimum 30° angles between intersecting roads
- **Intersection Merging**: Automatically merges intersections closer than 10 meters
- **Angle Optimization**: Adjusts intersection positions to improve angle distribution
- **Type Detection**: Identifies T-junctions, 4-way, and complex intersections

### 3. Road Hierarchy System
```javascript
const ROAD_WIDTHS = {
  highway: 24,  // Major arterials, limited access
  avenue: 16,   // Primary city roads
  street: 12,   // Standard city blocks
  local: 8      // Residential areas
}
```

### 4. Era-Based Evolution
- **Material Progression**:
  - Pre-1900: Dirt roads
  - 1900-1930: Cobblestone for major roads
  - 1930-1950: Mixed cobblestone/asphalt
  - 1950+: Asphalt standard, concrete highways
- **Width Adjustments**: Roads are narrower in early eras (×0.8) and wider in modern eras (×1.1)
- **Dynamic Upgrades**: Some streets upgrade to avenues in later eras

### 5. Advanced Generation Phases

#### Phase 1: City Centers
- Uses Poisson disk sampling for optimal distribution
- Number of centers varies by era (1 for 1890s, 3 for 2000s+)

#### Phase 2: Highway Network
- Connects city centers with organic highway paths
- Generates ring roads around major centers
- Creates natural curves using perpendicular sine offsets

#### Phase 3: Radial Roads
- Radiates from centers with golden angle distribution
- Variable density based on distance from center
- Organic curves with controlled perturbations

#### Phase 4: Adaptive Grid
- Finds empty regions between major roads
- Calculates regional orientation from nearby roads
- Generates aligned grids that respect existing infrastructure

#### Phase 5: Local Roads
- Identifies gaps in the network
- Fills with small clusters of local roads
- Ensures complete coverage

#### Phase 6: Network Connectivity
- Uses DFS to find disconnected components
- Connects isolated sections to main network
- Ensures full connectivity

#### Phase 7: Intersection Optimization
- Merges close intersections
- Adjusts positions for better angle distribution
- Removes redundant connections

#### Phase 8: Era Evolution
- Updates materials based on era
- Adjusts road widths
- Upgrades some roads in modern eras

## Algorithm Highlights

### Organic Path Generation
```javascript
generateOrganicPath(start, end, pathType) {
  // Creates natural curves between points
  // Uses sine-based perpendicular offsets
  // Varies curve strength by path type
  // Adds controlled random perturbations
}
```

### Adaptive Grid Generation
```javascript
generateAdaptiveGrid() {
  // Finds empty regions
  // Calculates local orientation
  // Generates aligned grid
  // Respects existing roads
}
```

### Connected Components
```javascript
findConnectedComponents() {
  // DFS traversal of road network
  // Identifies isolated sections
  // Returns component sets for connection
}
```

## Visual Quality Features

1. **Natural Curves**: Roads follow organic paths with realistic curves
2. **Variable Block Sizes**: Block dimensions vary based on location and era
3. **Proper Intersections**: No acute angles or overlapping roads
4. **Historical Accuracy**: Road patterns match era expectations
5. **Density Variation**: Higher density near centers, lower at edges

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Spatial Indexing**: Grid-based spatial index for O(1) proximity queries
2. **Typed Arrays**: Efficient Float32Array/Uint32Array for data transfer
3. **Incremental Generation**: Can generate in phases for large cities
4. **Node Snapping**: Automatic merging of nearby nodes

## Configuration Parameters

```javascript
GenerationConfig {
  seed: number              // For reproducible generation
  era: EraTag              // Historical period
  bounds: {width, height}  // City dimensions
  gridBias: 0.0-1.0       // Organic vs grid balance
  density: 0.1-1.0        // Road network density
  blockSizeMin/Max        // Block size range
  minIntersectionAngle    // Minimum angle constraint
  centerCount             // Number of city centers
}
```

## Integration with WebWorker
